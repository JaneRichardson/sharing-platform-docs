# 1. Supported browsers

Date: 2021-05-21

## Status

Pending

## Context

We need to conclude which browsers (and potentially versions) we will include in our testing scope.

## Proposal

Given Microsoft Internet Explorer has reached end-of-life in the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy and NHS Digital's subsequent move to [stop supporting Internet Explorer](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/standards-for-web-products/withdrawal-of-support-for-internet-explorer), we will do the same.

Shown below are the list of browsers we intend to test our application with:-

### Desktop

1. Google Chrome                
2. Mozilla Firefox              
3. Microsoft Edge               
4. Opera                        
5. Apple Safari                 

### Mobile

1. Chrome for Android
2. Microsoft Edge for Android
3. Opera Mini for Android
4. Opera Touch for Android
5. Chrome for iOS
6. Microsoft Edge for iOS
7. Opera Mini for iOS
8. Opera Touch for iOS

## Decision

A decision has not yet been reached on the full scope of our browser based testing strategy.  This document remains open for discussion and feedback.
