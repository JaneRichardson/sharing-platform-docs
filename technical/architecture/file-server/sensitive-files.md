# File Sensitivity

In the Beta timeframe we are focused on delivering the big-ticket items and as such will not have yet built the capability to categorise user generated content.  For this reason, the platform's terms and conditions will explicitely prohibit its use for sharing sensitive files etc.

Post-Beta, there is the expectation that we will revisit this approach, so please do raise an issue ticket if you are interested in learning more and willing to help us with the feature specification.
