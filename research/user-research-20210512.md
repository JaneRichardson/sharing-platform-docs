# FutureNHS User Research - 12 May 2021

## Objective
The focus of this user research was to gather perspectives from non-existing users and responses to wireframes from the UX design team. From a user background we wanted to learn their:
- Role in the NHS / related organisation
- Current awareness and understanding of the FutureNHS collaboration platform

The activities we asked them to perform on the wireframes were
- Platform registration
- Use of the user dashboard / 'homepage'
- Discoverability of new groups

## Methodology
For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview
Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participantâ€™s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.

## User background
We interviewed 3 non-existing members of the platform, 1 dormant user and 1 new user.
