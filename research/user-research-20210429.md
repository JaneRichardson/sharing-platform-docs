# FutureNHS User Research - 29 April 2021

## Objective
The focus of this user research was to gather information on how users use the current [FutureNHS collaboration platform](https://future.nhs.uk/) with respect to:
- how they would usually get started
- their use of the group dashboard / homepage
- their use of the page builder (workspace managers only)
- their use of forums.

We also used this research to gather research on wireframes for the new FutureNHS sharing platform on the:
- feedback on initial designs of the navigation, ‘Groups’ and ‘Forums’

## Methodology
For this round of research we used a remote moderated one-to-one user research methodology. The sessions were conducted via video conference and screen sharing meeting on Teams, and participants joined from their desktop. The moderator and participant could see and hear each other in order to conduct the interview. Chat functionality allowed the moderator to provide instructions, and links to the wireframes. Participants accessed the platform & wireframes on their desktop and shared their screen. The moderator was able to see the participant’s screen and used concurrent think aloud (CTA) to understand their behaviour and asked interview questions.

## User background
We interviewed 2 platform members and 4 platform managers in total.
All participants used the platform at least twice a week (often more). 

The main use of the members were:
- document sharing
- getting updates on COVID-19 services

and for workspace managers
- sharing documents
- making connections
- sharing best practice
- managing members and forums

All users were digitally capable and used a range of tools in their work including Microsoft Teams, Jira, Google Docs, Whatsapp, Facebook, Slack etc.

## Findings

### Use of FutureNHS collaboration platform
The core use of the platform varied by workspace, and also role e.g. member or manager. Key uses of the platform were:
- An area to push new content out to an audience.
- A discussion board to collaborate on documents.
- A way of bringing together separate trusts.

Members would often take a passive role, interested in keeping up to date with forums without necessarily  contributing questions or answers.

Some members used the platform to hunt for specific content or documentation. They did this using the search function and file management structure of their workspace.

Managers generally log in in an effort to keep their workspace dashboards fresh and engaging to drive use and repeat visits. Managers with platform experience and ability would also take advantage of functionality to drive polls and surveys on their workspace to inform future design decisions.

A key function of the platform was that of a document repository for collaborative use, however with roll out of tools like SharePoint, or Teams due to Covid that use case is becoming less common.

### Thoughts on FutureNHS collaboration platform
Feedback about the platform was broadly positive though all users had areas of frustration.

#### What works well
*Members*
- Workspaces can be valuable resources for content sharing.
- Forums are a valuable resource for staying up to date.
*Managers*
- Complete control over design can be a positive as some workspaces function very differently.
- Forums are an effective way of understanding member’s concerns and frustrations without becoming directly involved.

#### Barriers & Frustrations / Improvements
*Members*
- Inconsistent page building can lead to confusion and poor usability.
- It can be hard to find new content or documents on poorly managed pages.
- The promise of the platform as a one stop collaboration and sharing hub does not match it’s reality as a cumbersome tool.
- Searching for content is difficult.
- Forum colour scheme makes it difficult to understand the hierarchy of content.
- It’s hard to understand the content of a Forum thread before diving in.

*Managers*
- Building pages is a difficult and self taught process for users who are not tech savvy and do not love design.
- Managers feel they are not utilising the workspace to it’s best potential.
- Onboarding new users is laborious, and user management even more so.
- Want to be able to surface content from forums to the workspace homepage.
- Want to be able to preview workspace changes before going live.
